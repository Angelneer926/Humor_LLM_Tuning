"In an interview with David Letterman, Carter passed along an anecdote of a translation problem in Japan. Carter was speaking at a business lunch in Tokyo, where he decided to open his speech with a brief joke. He told the joke, then waited for the translator to announce the Japanese version. Even though the story was quite short, Carter was surprised by how quickly the interpreter was able to re-tell it. Even more impressive was the reaction from the crowd. Carter thought the story was cute, but not outright hilarious, yet the crowd broke right up. Carter was very flattered. After the speech, Carter wanted to meet the translator to ask him how he told the joke. Perhaps there is better way to tell the joke? When Carter asked how the joke had been told in Japanese, the translator responded, 'I told them, 'President Carter has told a very funny joke. Please laugh now.''",2.125

sleep in our bed?"" and he says, ""That bed is brand new, we just paid two

would.""

"An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. St. Peter checks his dossier and says, ""Ah, you''re an engineer--you're in the wrong place."" So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After awhile, they've got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy. One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, ""So, how's it going down there in hell?"" Satan replies, ""Hey, things are going great. We've got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next."" God replies, ""What?? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake--he should never have gotten down there; send him up here."" Satan says, ""No way."" I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping him."" God says, ""Send him back up here or I'll sue."" Satan laughs uproariously and answers, ""Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?""",3.906
"A group of girlfriends is on vacation when they see a 5-story hotel with a sign that reads: ""For Women Only."" Since they are without their boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go in. The bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works. ""We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there. It's easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you what's inside."" So they start going up and on the first floor the sign reads: ""All the men on this floor are short and plain."" The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor. The sign on the second floor reads: ""All the men here are short and handsome."" Still, this isn't good enough, so the friends continue on up. They reach the third floor and the sign reads: ""All the men here are tall and plain."" They still want to do better, and so, knowing there are still two floors left, they continued on up. On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect: ""All the men here are tall and handsome."" The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor. There they find a sign that reads: ""There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman.""",7.875

"There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all 
things mechanical.  After serving his company loyally for over 30 
years, he happily retired.  Several years later the company contacted 
him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with 
one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and 
everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail.  In 
desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so 
many of their problems in the past.
The engineer reluctantly took the challenge.  He spent a day studying 
the huge machine.  At the end of the day, he marked a small ""x"" in 
chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated, 
""This is where your problem is"".
The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The 
company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his 
service.They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The 
engineer responded briefly:
One chalk mark                       $1 
Knowing where to put it            $49,999
It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.
